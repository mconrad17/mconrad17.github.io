<h1>My Car</h1>

<P>As I noted previously, my favorite TV shows are about cars, and while I certainly can't put together a motor or remember the power to weight ratio of a Gulf GTI, I do bear a passion for cars and everything that goes with them. That being said, one would assume that such a guru like myself would drive something interesting, I'm ashamed to say I don't. I drive a 2004 Volvo XC70 Station Wagon that still has a cassette player and is currently parked outside, exposed to the elements. That's okay though as its not about what you drive but what you do with it. I myself do a lot with my car, I like to play classical music loudly and puff on a pipe, that Sherlock would approve of, as I drive to the grocery store. I also like to take my car on gravel roads or in the snow as it has all wheel drive and can produce magnificent fish tails under the right conditions. If I didn't spend all my money on lawn equipment or maps from the 1850s, I would likely modify my vehicle. I enjoy driving with friends into the mountains and hopefully I can conduct some long distance expeditions with my vehicle now that I'm in college. To quote Jeremy Clarkson, "speed and power," solves everything.</P>
