<h1>My Car</h1>

<P>As noted previously, my favorite TV shows are about cars, and while I certainly can't put together a motor or remember the power to weight ratio of a Gulf GTI, I've long bore a passion for cars. I myself drive a 2004 Volvo XC70 Station Wagon that still has a cassette player! Although my car may not be all that impressive, its what you do with it that matters. I myself enjoy going for drives in the countryside and playing classical music on its great stereo system. Sometimes I have a laugh and role through town brandishing a long suspended from my mouth producing strange looks from unsuspecting pedestrians. If I want to go for a bit of fun I take my car on gravel roads or in the snow as it has all wheel drive and can produce magnificent fish tails under the right conditions. To quote Jeremy Clarkson, "speed and power," solves everything.</P>
