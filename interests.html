<P>Benjamin Franklin once quoted, "Early to bed and early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise." I like to believe that discovering and developing various hobbies has a similar effect on one's own development and personality. That being said, I myself pursue a number of strange activities including: skiing; driving my car; reproducing medieval armor; starting my own country; and watching my favorite TV show, "Top Gear".</P>

<P>While the previous activities consume a great portion of my time, my greatest thrills and best stories spring from my adventures as a budding entrepreneur. Although I label myself as an "entrepreneur", a more accurate description would be, "a creative individual seeking an easier way to make a buck". While I would certainly do nothing in violation of the law or which may harm another individual, some of my stories are perhaps best left alone. That being said, I run a number of small operations ranging from landscaping and selling walking sticks to gambling on horses.</P>

<P>The picture at the top of the page features me and my small collection of medieval arms and armor. Having developed a deep interest in medieval history and warfare at a young age, I began producing my own replica armor a few years ago learning from a friend, how to make the small chainmail patches used for scrubbing pans. Producing chainmail let alone smithing plate armor is a very time consuming task however, I developed my skills over the course of several months producing everything from the jump rings (individual rings of the armor) to the finished piece itself. Completing my junior year of high school, I had produced an entire suit of armor which you can see me wearing in my home page.</P>
