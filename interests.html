<h1><center>Interests</center></h1>

<P>Benjamin Franklin once quoted "Early to bed and early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise,". I like to believe that pursuing one's interests and living life in a jubilant manner should produce a similar effect. That being said, I myself pursue a number of strange and often business related hobbies including: skiing; driving my car; reproducing medieval armor; establishing and developing a quite legitimate independent nation state; picking the ponies, when I'm near the track; exercising my second amendment right; watching, "Top Gear" and, "The Grand Tour", my two favorite TV shows; scheming of new, somewhat shady business ventures, nothing dangerous or harmful, usually just selling walking sticks or collecting loans where I'm not supposed to; and adding to my ever growing collection of antique toys, coins, etc.</P>

<P>Of the activities mentioned above, one of my more interesting endevers certainly is the "reproduction of medieval armor". Having been exposed, first hand, to the wonders of the old world, during a family trip to Ireland when I was eight years old, I've since been deeply interested in medieval history and warfare. That being said, I only ever enjoyed history in the museum or in a book until a couple years ago when I was introduced to the idea of actually making medieval armor. Having invested some time watching youtube videos on making chainmail and money to acquire the proper tools and wire, I began producing small scraps of 12th century garments before school and in the evening. The process, though simple, is a real art form and extremely time consuming. That being said I was obsessed by the patterns and play and weight of the armor. Long story schort, I ended up producing a shirt of chainmail the end of my sophomore year of high school. By the end of my junior year, I had produced an entire suit of armor which you can see me wearing above. I haven't made much of anything in the past 6 months however, anything made of chainmail is one of those "months long" projects though, I wont hesitate to pick up the pliers and wire when my next idea hits me.</P>
